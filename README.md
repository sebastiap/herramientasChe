# What is this proyect about?
+ This proyect started as a Vue.js practice and scaleted to a full Web App.
- This is actually a "Tribute" to the Original proyect.[^tribute] .
- The original proyect was for a testing area who needed a lot of repetitive task and the organization was very restrictive with using externals tools for internal info.
- This site riped off every reference to the all proyect and replaced it with generic names and titles.
- Can be useful? As a concept maybe. Is a little rusty and if i need something similar i think is better to star from scratch.
- The proyect is deprecated, i won't continue making updates.
- This was my first proyect in Vue. So don't expect much :D .
